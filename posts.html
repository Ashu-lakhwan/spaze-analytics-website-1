                    Alternative to Conditional Formatting in Excel
                  </h4>

                  <p class="card-text">Hi All,</p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    Many people find conditional formatting a little
                    complicated, specially when they have to do a little more
                    then colouring cells or text/numbers in the cells. You can
                    do much more than conditional formatting with a good
                    understanding of Custom Formats in Excel. Excel see a cells
                    format as having four Sections. These are, from left to
                    right Positive numbers, Negative Numbers, Zero Values and
                    Text values (“Positive Number “;” Negative Number “;” Zero
                    “;” Text”).Each of these Sections are separated by a semi
                    colon (;). If you create a custom number format you do not
                    have to specify all four sections. It is also very important
                    to understand that the formatting of a cells value does not
                    affect its underlying true value.

                    To show this we can type any number into cell A1, then go to

                  <p class="card-text">Hi All,</p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    Recently, I worked on a project which included creation and
                    automation of Pivot charts.I have always been fascinated by
                    them, and it is one of my favourite features in MS Excel. I
                    am going to list down some of the major advatages of using a
                    Pivot Chart over a Simple Chart.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    The PivotChart report gives you the eye-catching appeal and
                    benefits of a graphic illustration of data while also giving
                    you the dynamic flexibility and different views of data that
                    you find in a PivotTable® report.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    With various types of graphs around 100 and including
                    different view such as 2D, 3D the user can get almost clear
                    idea about the data from it. The graphs too are very user
                    friendly with all flexibilities of a pivot table report.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    I have worked with pivot charts in a lot of projects in the
                    past as well. The only difference this time was that earlier
                    the application were based on Excel 2003, but this time the
                    application was Excel 2007 based. I was amazed when i found
                    out the differences in Pivot Charts of Excel 2007 compared
                    to 2003. I will write about it in detail in my next post.

                  <p class="card-text">Hi All,</p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    Found another amazing Chart animation workbook courtesy of
                    excelhero.com. This one is by far the best i have seen that
                    can be created in Excel without the need of tools like
                    XCelcius or crystal reports etc. I can bet that if you
                    present your data to your clients in this kind of chart, it
                    will be a stand out instantly. But creating such an
                    animation in a chart would require knowledge of VBA and
                    excel objects such as named ranges etc. Let me explain how
                    this animation works:
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    – There is a dropdown at the top left corner of the workbook
                    with “North” as the default value.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    – You can select other values such as “South”, “West”,
                    “East” from the dropdown and watch the chart move.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    – You can also change the chart type as Column, Line and
                    Area.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    Please catch up with me if you need any more assistance.

                    Microsoft has launched the latest version of MS Office 2013
                    also known as MS Office 15 after a break of 3 years. An
                    improvement to the previous version was badly required for
                    Microsoft to consolidate its receding market share because
                    of competition from Google Docs and Open Office platforms
                    which also have an added advantage of being freeware
                    software’s. Microsoft has launched a host of new features
                    such as integration with Skydrive for Online Sharing and
                    cloud computing platforms. This also requires better system
                    requirements to install office 2013 such as Windows 7 or
                    newer.

                    The 32-bit version of Office is installed by default. Even
                    if your computer is running a 64-bit version of Windows, we
                    recommend that you install the 32-bit version of Office
                    because it is more compatible with the applications and
                    add-ins that work with Office. If you do want to install the
                    64-bit version of Office, you can do so by taking the
                    following steps:

                    It is not possible to install both the 64-bit version and
